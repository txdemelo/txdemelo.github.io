I have taught logic in various modes. In the Spring of 2021, I had to teach it fully online. I adapted my material to [Carnap.io](https://carnap.io/), which provides students with, among others, automated proof-checking, model-checking, and proof-assisting tools. Below, you'll find my syllabus and Carnap.io sample material. 



- [Syllabus](/assets/pdf/Syllabus-logic.pdf)
- [A problem set on truth-functional semantics](/assets/embedded/logiccarnapsample1)
- [A problem set on natural deduction](https://carnap.io/shared/txdemelo@gmail.com/Problem%20Set%205.md)

At the end of the course, I was interested in whether using Carnap i) added new difficulties to the course, ii) promoted student's learning in new ways, and iii) would be, from studentâ€™s perspectives, advisable in an in-person course. So I conducted an informal survey.
