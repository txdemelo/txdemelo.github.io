I have taught logic in various modes. In the Spring of 2021, I had to teach it fully online. I adapted my material to [Carnap.io](https://carnap.io/), which provides students with, among others, automated proof-checking, model-checking, and proof-assisting tools. Below, you'll find my Syllabus and sample material. At the end of the course, I was interested in whether using the platform i) added new difficulties to the course, ii) promoted student's learning in new ways, iii) would be, from studentâ€™s perspectives, advisable in a in-person course. So I conducted an informal survey.
