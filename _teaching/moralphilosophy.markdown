I have taught `Introduction to Moral Philosophy' in various ways: in a normal term, summer session, fully online. 

Typically in this course, we see a bit of metaethics and of theories of well-being, and then we focus on normative theories and applied questions about abortion, genetic engineering, poverty, and treatment of non-human animals. 

Here's a sample [syllabus](/assets/pdf/Syllabus-knowledge-and-reality.pdf).

        </a>
