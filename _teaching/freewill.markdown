I taught Free Will online and async in the Summer of 22. Summer courses are intensive---3 credits in 6 weeks. Async classes have no live discussions. These two elements combined require a different course structure. For example, it's important that students have a routine ("Every Monday, do X"), and also that they have introductory texts that are accessible, concise, and connected to primary source readings in obvious ways. Teaching Free Will, I assigned Robert Kane's 'A Contemporary Introduction to Free Will' (and Helen Beebee's 'Free Will' to more advanced students) and paired them up with primary readings. [Here's the syllabus](/assets/pdf/Syllabus-free-will.pdf).

Images and diagrams can represent complex ideas in simpler ways. Thus, I have been encouraging students to use them when trying to grasp and reason about abstract ideas. As van Inwagen [exemplified](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/23557087.pdf), Free Will allows for some interesting applications of this method. For example, in the first homework in the course, I ask students to represent determinism, fatalism, and other views, by modifying a 'Garden of Forking Paths' figure. [Here's the assignment](/assets/pdf/free-will-sample-assignment1.pdf), and soon you will find [samples of drawings by students here]().
