#Write your biography below ---. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

#Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

#Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

#Here's my [CV](assets/pdf/CV.pdf).

Hi there! I'm a PhD Candidate in the  [Department of Philosophy](https://thecollege.syr.edu/philosophy/) at [Syracuse University](https://www.syracuse.edu/). Before that, I took an [MA in Logic and Metaphysics](https://ppglm.wordpress.com/) at [Rio de Janeiro Federal University](https://ufrj.br/en/), and a BA in Philosophy at [Ceará Federal University](http://www.ufc.br/).


My research has revolved around properties, relations, and categories. In metaphysics, as elsewhere, the goal is to make the foundation just enough to build everything else up. Currently, I am investigating how properties and relations must be if we want to build very high indeed. Click on [research](/research/) for a conception of relations that supports a lot, and to see what else I have been up to. 


I enjoy my research area, but I love teaching more broadly too. I have taught and TA'ed for courses in ethics, logic, metaphysics and epistemology, human nature, free will, media ethics, and others, at [Syracuse University](https://thecollege.syr.edu/philosophy/) and [Federal University of Alagoas](https://ichca.ufal.br/graduacao/filosofia/).
