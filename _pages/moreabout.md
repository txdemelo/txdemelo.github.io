In [IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet), 'Thiago' is something close to /t͡ʃiˈ aɡu/.  That is, 'Thi' is like 'chee' in '<b>chee</b>se'. The 'a' is like in 'f<b>a</b>ther'; 'g' as in '<b>g</b>o'; and 'o' as 'oo' in 'b<b>oo</b>k'. The stress is on 'a'.  Thus, it's something like "chee-A-g-oo".  
  
My work has been cited as 'de Melo, T.X.'. I am happy with this. My real last name would be too long. ('de' is also a preposition though, like 'van' in 'van Inwagen' and 'van Heijenoort'. Alphabetization rules may vary.)
