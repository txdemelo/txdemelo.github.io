In [IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet), 'Thiago' is something like /t͡ʃiˈ aɡu/.  That is, 'Thi' is like 'chee' in 'cheese'. The 'a' is like in 'father'; 'g' as in 'go'; and 'o' as 'oo' in 'book'. The stress is on 'a'.  Thus, it's something like "<u>chee-A-g-oo</u>", I guess.  
  
My work has been cited as 'de Melo, T.X.'. I am happy with this. (My real last name would be too long.) 'de' is also a preposition though, like 'van' in 'van Inwagen' and 'van Heijenoort'. Thus, alphabetization rules will vary, I believe.
