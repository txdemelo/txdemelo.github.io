My research area is metaphysics. I have been focusing on the
metaphysics of properties and relations, which, basilar as it is, led me
to study further phenomena both in metaphysics and in intersections with
language, logic, mind, and meta-ethics. My PhD dissertation is on the
notion of fundamental/natural relation. See a description of it [below](#diss). I have
published some of what the dissertation is becoming already; this is listed
[further below](#publications). And other parts of it are being worked
out as separate papers too. See [works in progress](#inprogress).

Besides my dissertation topic, I have been studying other problems I expect to contribute to in the future. These involve: laws and counterfactuals, higher-order logic and quantification, and ontological categories and metaphysical explanation. 

dissertation {#diss}
============

I am sympathetic to Lewis\' view that naturalness/fundamentality explains a lot (namely, similarity, dissimilarity, intrinsicality, duplication, causation, laws
of nature, meaning, and thought.) Indeed, I think the list can be
extended (e.g. to essence, change, contradiction, categories, category mistakes, modes of being). But to do so, we need to disentangle the notion of naturalness
from Lewis\' own specific metaphysical commitments. To do all that, the structure of
naturalness must be richer than we might have thought when within the Lewisian system. For starters, naturalness is not a
monadic singular property of monadic properties (some of which happen to
be properties of tuples). Naturalness is better construed as a
relation between categories and relations; moreover, not less surprisingly, naturalness must be somehow attributable to slots of relations.

publications
============

-   In *Essence and Naturalness*, I briefly introduce some aspects of
    the theory of naturalness that I have been developing, and I show
    how it can improve analyses of essence in terms of standard
    necessity. In a way, the paper suggests that the ultimate lessons
    from Kit Fine\'s famous essentialist claims involving singleton
    {Socrates} concern our conception of *relations* (or naturalness
    thereof), not essence.\

    Quarterly* page](https://doi.org/10.1093/pq/pqz014), with abstract etc.

work in progress {#inprogress}
----------------

I list here brief descriptions of papers I am working on, some of which
under review. Please email me if you have any interest.

-   A paper on naturalness and relations.
-   A paper on naturalness and categories.
-   A paper on alternative theories of naturalness. (To disentangle
    naturalness from Lewis\' system, we must systematically study the
    alternatives. I am developing a map and taxonomy based on a
    literature survey.)
-   A paper in which I offer a better best-system analysis of laws of
    nature, one that can resist arguments that appeal to the counter-factual independence of laws. (Though my theory of naturalness has implications on lawhood
    so conceived, this particular paper isn\'t part of the dissertation
    project. On this one, I assume Lewis\' notion of naturalness. What I
    change is the humean mosaic on which laws supervene. And I do it in
    a way that laws won\'t depend on having instances; thus faring
    better than Lewis\' account in some aspects.)
