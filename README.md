This is the repo for my personal website, which can be seen [here](https://txdemelo.github.io). It was forked from [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio), a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) initially based on [\*folio](https://github.com/bogoli/-folio), both published under the terms of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
